Changes
=======

1.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

Show frame objects as well (fixes LP#361704).

New functions: show_growth(), show_chain().

find_backref_chain(obj, ...) returns [obj] instead of None when a chain
could not be found.  This makes show_chain(find_backref_chain(...), ...)
not break.

Show how many references were skipped from the output of
show_refs/show_backrefs by specifying ``too_many``.

Make show_refs() descend into modules.

Do not highlight classes that define a __del__, highlight only instances of
those classes.

Option to show reference counts in show_refs/show_backrefs.


1.4.0 (2010-11-03)
------------------

Compatibility with Python 2.4 and 2.5 (tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile has no
delete argument).

New function: most_common_types().


1.3.1 (2010-07-17)
------------------

Rebuild an sdist with no missing files (fixes LP#606604).

Added MANIFEST.in and a Makefile to check that setup.py sdist generates
source distributions with no files missing.


1.3 (2010-07-13)
----------------

Highlight objects with a __del__ method.

Fixes LP#483411: suggest always passing [obj] to show_refs, show_backrefs,
since obj might be a list/tuple.

Fixes LP#514422: show_refs, show_backrefs don't create files in the current
working directory any more.  Instead they accept a filename argument, which
can be a .dot file or a .png file.  If None or not specified, those functions
will try to spawn xdot as before.

New extra_info argument to graph-generating functions (patch by Thouis Jones,
LP#558914).

setup.py should work with distutils now (LP#604430, thanks to Randy Heydon).


1.2 (2009-03-25)
----------------

Project website, public source repository, uploaded to PyPI.

No code changes.


1.1 (2008-09-10)
----------------

New function: show_refs() for showing forward references.

New functions: typestats() and show_most_common_types().

Object boxes are less crammed with useless information (such as IDs).

Spawns xdot if it is available.


1.0 (2008-06-14)
----------------

First public release.
